# Learn-to-Code-Initiative

Data science, analytics, AI, big data are becoming widely used in many fields, that leads to the ever-increasing demand of data analysts, data scientists and other data professionals. Due to that, data science education is now a hot topic for educators and entrepreneurs.

In this project, we will design a program curriculum for a Data Science and Artificial Intelligence program that focuses on both technical and business/soft skills that will equip students to pursue a successful career as a data scientist, data analyst, data manager, business analyst, AI system designer, etc.

We have proposed a new startup seeking to address the issue of unemployment in North America. The startup queries an individualâ€™s skills and connects them with the courses necessary to find gainful employment in the field of data science.
